Robert Christgau, the self-proclaimed "Dean of American rock critics," is "best known for his terse, letter-graded capsule album reviews, composed in a concentrated, fragmented prose style featuring layered clauses, caustic wit, one-liner jokes, political digressions, and allusions ranging from common knowledge to the esoteric." (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Christgau)

For this project, we've scraped two sets of data from Robert Christgau's website (https://www.robertchristgau.com/).

First, I'll be comparing his letter scoring over the 50-or-so year period he's been reviewing albums to see if he's become more lenient with his scoring over time.

Secondly, I've trained an AI to see if the letter score can be predicted from the capsule review.
