In a microcosm where nobody can tell good pop junk from utter shit anymore, his first four cuts are a refresher course: one Slim Harpo let get away, a callow Goffin-King throwaway, his own tasteless Buddhist joke, and \"Volare.\" Each the real thing, each different, each undreamed by the Fanzine Filosofy. But after that he lets things slide, from a straight (for him) declaration of love to a Lowell Fulson boogie to covers the Fleshtones could think of. These are parlous times, Alex. Sloppy\\'s getting harder to bring off, and cute ain\\'t enough.',\n",
       "  'At first I found this a depressing combination of trivial ambitions and simple greed--the hit, \"Sha-La-La,\" is his slightest to date, and side two might easily have been unflattened with a cover. But I kept playing \"Sha-La-La\" to reach \"Take Me to the River,\" a synthesis of the spiritual root of Green\\'s music (call it God) and its emotional referent (by which I mean sex) that may be his greatest song. And in the end I loved \"Sha-La-La\" too.',\n",
       "  \"Green's recent instability is usually blamed on hot grits and the short half-life of formula soul, but I'm beginning to wonder whether drummer Al Jackson, who died in 1975, wouldn't have steadied the last two albums, and I expect that this is an attempt to compensate. Wilson Pickett it ain't, but it is the straightest (and hardest) soul Green has put out since his breakthrough--the horns way up, the vocals shouting confidence and technique. Problem is, it's forced--the Hi folks (like most of their peers) can't turn out songs distinctive enough to hold up under the treatment. It's still full of fire, though, and Green is still the finest popular singer of the decade, and I'm still gratified to see him on his feet.\",\n",
       "  'Reports that Green was no longer writing all his own material worried some supporters, but in fact composition has counted for very little in Green\\'s recent work and is generally improved here. This is his most careful and concise music since Livin\\' for You; in fact, it\\'s too damn concise, clocking in at 26:39 for eight cuts, although the sustaining 6:07-minute disco disc version of \"Wait Here\" would have put it over half an hour. None of the originals are quite up to \"Belle\" or \"I Feel Good,\" but every song is solid, and two audacious covers of songs heretofore recorded exclusively by women are his best in five years. The intensity of the 2:12-minute \"I Say a Little Prayer\" (dig that male chorus) is precious in a time of dance-length cuts, and although I know Green devotes \"To Sir With Love\" to his dad, I\\'m glad Proposition 6 was defeated before its release.',\n",
       "  \"Think of it this way: he knew that sex was running out of inspiration for him, so he moved on to God as his source of ecstasy--an ecstasy he approaches most readily in what he really lives for, music. I might end up praising God myself if He or She gave me the most beautiful voice in creation and then let me keep it when I descended into purgatory. As it is, I'll praise Al for his lead guitar, which lends such a down-by-the-riverside feel to these rolling gospel tunes that you hardly notice the violins.\",\n",
       "  'You can tell when Green is bad live because he doesn\\'t sing, often deserting mike or even stage for emphasis, which would be hard to render on disc. So his in-concert double had to be pretty strong. Like Otis\\'s Live in Europe, it captures a sensitive soul man at his toughest and most outgoing. But unlike Live in Europe it offers no ecstatic epiphanies to make up for the forced crescendos--\"I Feel Good\" is louder in this version but wilder on The Belle Album. And speaking of loud, somebody fucked up the drum mix.',\n",
       "  \"It's not that Al's reunion with Willie Mitchell makes no difference--the difference is fairly striking when you listen for it. What's striking when you think about it, though, is that you have to listen for it. Leroy Hodges's famous bottom keeps the record flowing like none of Green's other Jesus LPs, but it's still songs that make or break--and in this case do neither.\",\n",
       "  \"By now he's B.B. King or Ray Charles--his genre exercises are more joyful than lesser mortals' great leaps forward.

Even the electrofunk belongs.\",\n",

       "  \"I know, what could be worse than a sci-fi concept album by Al Kooper, who hasn't been good for a whole LP since early electric Dylan? Only it's really solid, without one bad cut.

       "  'Reggae from a multilingual Ivory Coast star who puts message up front, this probably wouldn\\'t get over on words even if you understood Mandingue or Dioula--in French and English, the politics are naive and toothless. As usual in West African pop, the voice is too mild, and as usual in West African reggae, the rhythm section is too buoyant. But glancing off such dance tunes as \"Idjidja\" and \"Kiti\" and, yes, \"Come Back Jesus\" (not to mention the base-covering \"Sébé Allah Yé\"), the singing completes an eloquently transatlantic groove--Afropop dread, a fast-flowing stream whose depth can\\'t be fathomed.

       "  'Here be nineteen four-track demos recorded on a Tascan Portastudio between pre-Shams 1987 and post-Diary of a Mod Housewife 1997 and released in this form in 2019, with just one selection apiece from that pioneering female trio and Rigby\\'s superb solo debut and follow-up albums. Their demo provenance isn\\'t a positive--even the solid Nashville-style arrangements she favored pre-Wreckless Eric added more oomph than she generally manages here whether solo or with helpers. But Rigby has been one of our finest songwriters for a quarter century, and the only reason this material stayed in that Portastudio so long is that she couldn\\'t figure out where else to put it. So though the three tracks preceding the \"Tomorrow\\'s All We Got\" closer could use some of that oomph, the quality here is impressively consistent, with two songs it would have been hard to slip onto her early albums altogether remarkable: \"Mrs. Gordon Ray Thomas,\" in which an imprisoned armed robber explains why her crime spree made her \"a happy woman,\" and \"Contractor,\" in which asbestos breaks up a marriage none too soon.',\n",

Michael Bivins\\'s juxtaposition of boy sopranos against dissonant jackbeats is pedagogy at its finest. \"Spydermann,\" which also sounds kind of like \"Poison,\" is in the great tradition of Mother Earth\\'s \"Marvel Group.\" And sampling their parents is a cute idea.',\n",

Although her romantic ups and downs aren\\'t the disaster she believes sometimes, she really would like to know if she\\'s \"ever gonna have sex again.\" Answer--definitely. She\\'s attractive if by some juvenile standards mature, and she feels the love in her and the lust in her at the same time, which always helps. If only the millions of women in her situation had the time and funds to test-drive alt-country CDs, she\\'d be as famous as Lucinda.',\n",
       "  'Between 1996 and 2005, the 37-to-46-year-old ex-wife of excellent drummer Will Rigby released five excellent-to-superb pre-Americana CDs stocked with more terrific songs than any competing non-rapper except maybe Jon Langford--including Bob Dylan on his last great run, although I\\'ll give you Sleater-Kinney while noting that songs per se aren\\'t really what they do. Concrete, class-conscious, cutting, forlorn or funny or both, Rigby\\'s lyrics chronicled a single mom\\'s quest for love and sex, so of course they were never taken as seriously as \"Cold Irons Bound.\" Only then she hooked up with Wreckless Eric, who\\'s ridden \"Whole Wide World\" for four otherwise marginal decades, in a marriage so engrossing her writing slowed down to two hers-and-his albums. So now comes her first solo work since her great run, with Eric\\'s production lending an unmannerly distorto gravitas that suits its audacity. If you don\\'t want to hear a 58-year-old female singer-songwriter litcrits have never heard of impersonating Philip Roth emailing Bob Dylan about his Nobel, you probably think she\\'s on Dylan\\'s side, and you\\'re wrong. Robert Altman also gets a song, as does an unnamed sack of shit she resists in her mind by imagining she\\'s Tony Soprano, Lucky Thompson, or Walter White--the NAACP one not the Breaking Bad one, as Wikipedia helped me figure out, after which I looked up the unbowed Thompson and recalled that Soprano had a specialty in assassinations.',\n",

But give DiFranco the chance and she may just make you like her ancient formula for self-indulgent songpoetry.

In the spare and agile Andy Stochansky, who isn\\'t averse to powering up but more characteristically states and embellishes a single eccentric line with brushes or mallets or lightly wielded sticks, she may have found the best folk-rock drummer who\\'s ever lived, and this live double-CD, which draws liberally on her formative folk-punk years for those who only caught on with Dilate, is his showcase. Joined as well by the supplest of her several bassists, Gang of Four stalwart Sara Lee, DiFranco proves herself not just miraculously arch and sisterly and sexy and effervescent, but a bandleader who has wiggled free of deadening acoustic-with-backup commonplaces--and evolved from the truth of \"Smile pretty and watch your back\" to that of \"We lose sight of everything when we have to keep checking our backs.\"',\n",

Always underlying her bull-session eloquence, a hook no matter the message, is the supple, seductive, self-amused musicality that puts her records across. A typical touch here is her choice of world-jazz-ambient trumpeter Jon Hassell to decorate the 14-minute spoken-word finale \"Pulse\": \"you crawled into my bed/like some sort of giant insect/and I found myself spellbound/at the sight of you there/beautiful and grotesque/and all the rest of that bug stuff.\" \"That bug stuff\"--who else would dare it?',\n",

Me, I\\'m not so sure it doesn\\'t just seem that way because there\\'s no way we can be intimate with their worlds anymore.

This is no \"Love and Theft\" or Modern Times, neither of which is muffled by anything as indistinct as \"I\\'ve Made Up My Mind to Give Myself to You\" (though I do wonder who \"you\" is) or \"Black Rider\" (though \"The size of your cock will get you nowhere\" gets me every time). But I love how \"Goodbye Jimmy Reed\" rides the hush-mouthed groove of the most simplistic of the blues giants like it\\'s leading a parade, and how the comic Frankenstein fantasy \"My Own Version of You\" sums up the musical grave-robbing Dylan has been transmuting into original art for 60 years now. As does \"Murder Most Foul\" itself, in this context both an elegy for and a celebration of all the dark betrayals, stunted gains, enduring pleasures, and ecstatic releases of an American era Dylan has inflected as undeniably as any artist even if he doesn\\'t understand it any better than you, me, or whoever killed imperfect vessel JFK.',\n",

Even Grupo Folklorico, whom I love live and admire on record, rarely find their way to my turntable. But I play this for everyone I can. Cachao--real name Israel Lopez--helped invent salsa, and here recreates two phases of its evolution. The style of side one dates from the '50s and sounds more or less like the small-group salsa of today; although I appreciate the dynamics of its percussion, I'm not drawn to it. But the style of side two--which dates from 1938, when Cachao claimed the genteel danzon for black rhythm in Havana--I find breathtaking in its conjunction of restrained swing and elegant romanticism. Because it is simultaneously suave and audacious, it reminds me a little of early Duke Ellington, although finally it's more conventional.

Working with Paquito D'Rivera, Néstor Torres, Chocolate Armenteros, et al., Cachao cut 30 tunes one week last May, and these 12 alone run over 76 minutes. Far less hectic than New York salsa, often with a stately charanga feel, they respect Cachao's roots in the old danzon tradition, but the youngbloods' heat and surface motion stimulate a veteran or more Miami weddings and bar mitzvahs than he can count.

The way I feel it, the perfectly listenable 1959 and 1974 sessions recycled on Kubaney's La Leyenda Vol. 1 overdo the ballroom politesse.

The stylistic range of these 32 high-level selections is audible without a scorecard--playful savannah-pop harmonies, tight hotel bands with their dance numbers, many English lyrics, enough benga to scratch that itch, and numerous one-of-a-kinds. Don't expect much airy soukous a la Guitar Paradise of East Africa--that was more a Tanzanian thing.

For them, it\\'s not about stylistic aspiration. They want the sounds, not the music per se or its cultural accoutrements.

Mixed into the star persona are protest (\"Hard Rain\") and antiprotest (\"My Back Pages\"), callow ass man (\"All I Really Want to Do\") and manly ass man (\"Lay Lady Lay\"). And just in case you think you already own it all, five of the twenty-two cuts are previously uncollected or unreleased. Three of them have been established as indubitable classics by other artists, and the other two begin and end the album.

Dylan's new stance is as disconcerting as all the previous ones, but the quickest and deepest surprise is in the music itself. By second hearing its loveliness is almost literally haunting, an aural déjà vu.

On Joel Zoss\\'s \"Stayed Too Long at the Fair\" and Jackson Browne\\'s \"Under the Falling Sky\" she dares any sensitive type to wax lyrical without a drum kit.

This is easily Paisley\\'s strongest album since American Saturday Night--not a bum track, loaded with good jokes (including, after several failed attempts, one about the internet), hymns to marriage haters will hate because they don\\'t have what conjugal love takes, and, word of honor, a fun Mick Jagger cameo. It begins with something called \"Heaven South,\" which one kind of hater will dismiss as escapist piffle but I say is Paisley\\'s way of telling another kind of hater to quit feeling sorry for themselves and be grateful for what they got.

Like the book, this ends where it begins--at the huge old copper beech tree that anchored his childhood, except that since he last visited the county has cut it to the street.

Cohen had reached a state of permanent equilibrium by the year 2000, a revered cult artist in his late sixties with a multimillion-dollar catalogue and a mild case of agoraphobia.

Only then his longtime manager sold his publishing out from under his nose and absconded with the proceeds, and at 70 he found himself down to his last 150 grand. So in early 2008, aged 73, he launched a money-making world tour that has continued ever since. Offered a ticket by a friend, I walked in a fond skeptic and walked out a convert. The miraculous show I witnessed, where Cohen literally skipped on and off stage, lasted even longer than this two-and-a-half-hour double-CD, which will now be my Cohen of choice even though its songs are pretty much duplicated on the excellent Essential Leonard Cohen. The band is on it, the backup singers are solicitous, and Cohen's husk of a voice has been juiced up by the exercise. But the difference isn't the performances per se. It's the audience interactions. Gracious to a fault, Cohen is no longer detached. As practiced as his profuse thank yous are, his gratitude for the adoration of his cult is palpable not just in his stage talk but in the warmth and good humor with which he celebrates an oeuvre that no longer makes him a dime. Though I'd say it's less, Hank Williams may still be a hundred floors above him in the tower of song. But Cohen is no longer wondering how lonely things can get.\",\n",

Framed by two unembittered accounts of how he makes his living and dotted with illustrative patter, it has its heart-tuggers (\"Your Mother and I,\" written to explain the inevitable breakup to his and Suzzy Roche\\'s daughter), but mostly it presents him as what he is--a talented wag who came in his cummerbund, dropped clown acid, and never became a star. It should cheer any over-30 bad boy who can forget that his spotty sex life and pathetic adventures in substance abuse will never be as entertaining as this born entertainer\\'s. It may also convince the bad boy\\'s squeeze that things could be worse.',\n",

Handy\\'s hightailing \"Ramblin\\' Blues\" if he thought it was good for a drink. And in Wainwright\\'s plentifully illustrated and annotated two-CD tribute, where nine of the 29 selections are new songs by Wainwright and/or producer Dick Connette, Poole stands as a touchstone of a bygone era. Wainwright is such a card that you don\\'t think of him as a singer, but he puts more throat and thorax into the sentimental ballads than Poole had in him, and his barn burners are louder and faster without approaching Poole\\'s rooted assurance or reckless abandon.

In one song he\\'s a ghost; another features a reflection his late father wrote about his own late father; the one that begins \"Somebody else I knew just died\" is followed by the one called \"The Days That We Die.\" Family members abound, including the late Kate McGarrigle in a remake of her sole co-write with her husband, from before either was 30, which happens to be called \"Over the Hill.\" There are cameos from Ramblin\\' Jack Elliott, Chris Smither, John Scofield, the winsome Dame Edna Everage; Tom Lehrer declined but loved how Wainwright fit the word \"Mercurochrome\" into \"My Meds.\" With Elliott, Loud-O bids for a do-over: \"You don\\'t know what you\\'re doin\\' and you can\\'t just wait;/You go ahead and do it and then it\\'s too late/You need a double lifetime.\" After he goes down on his knees and prays, as he promises he will, this album will be Exhibit A on his application.',\n",

And forthcome they fucking well do. No man as strong as Louis Armstrong entertains out of contempt--he lives to give pleasure, and he\\'s so confident in his love for this material that he can do anything he wants to it. \"Rockin\\' Chair\" and \"That\\'s My Desire\" are as funny as death and sex, which he knows damn well they\\'re about. \"Black and Blue\" isn\\'t funny at all.',\n",

Never has Lou sounded more Ginsbergian, more let-it-all-hang-out than on this, his most controlled, plainspoken, deeply felt, and uninhibited album. Even his unnecessarily ideological heterosexuality is more an expression of mood than a statement of policy; he sounds glad to be alive, so that horror and pain become occasions for courage and eloquence as well as bitterness and sarcasm. Every song comes at the world from a slightly different angle, and every one makes the others stronger. Reed\\'s voice--precise, conversational, stirring whether offhand or inspirational--sings his love of language itself, with Fernando Saunders\\'s bass articulating his tenderness and the guitars of Robert Quine and Reed himself slashing out with an anger he understands better all the time.',\n",

Here both ends approach the middle. \"Legendary Hearts\" and \"Betrayed\" clarify Reed\\'s commitment by laying out the down side of romantic marriage; \"Bottoming Out\" and \"The Last Shot\" and the elegiac \"Home of the Brave\" excise melodrama from his waves of fear. Equally important, \"Martial Law\" and \"Don\\'t Talk to Me About Work\" and the almost, well, liberal \"Powwow\" prove that sometimes his great new band is just a way for him to write great new songs, which is what his endurance had better be about in the end.',\n",

Instead of straining fruitlessly to top himself, Reed has settled into a pattern as satisfying as what he had going with the Velvets, though by definition it isn\\'t as epochal.

But there\\'s more regret than rage, and no sense of finality, as if he\\'s been through too much to stay mean. And note that his relationships endure, including the one with Mike Rathke, Fernando Saunders, and Tony Smith, now the longest-running band of his roving career. With Lou\\'s guitar firmly at the helm, they impart something like tragic beauty not just to intended soul-shakers like \"Ecstasy\" and the 18-minute \"Possum,\" but to the existentialist joke \"The Modern Dance\" and the cheater\\'s diatribe \"Mad\"--which I call the most original song on the record even if Reed prefers the one about the white slave and the black master.',\n",

After that the songs are fine, but it\\'s down to a big not enormous, handsome not beautiful voice that\\'s every bit as strong as the will of this singer-by-nature and writer-by-nurture. So at home in blues and country that she won\\'t abide a rock and roll pigeonhole, she fought seven years to do an album her way. She can make a winner out of any song that spurns the clichés she\\'s too avid and sensible to resort to, and why any record man would want to order her around I can only guess.

The most powerful track on this Springsteen-meticulous work of songcraft is the raw, bare, strophic threnody \"Pineola,\" where the truest poetic stroke is the bereftly banal \"And they went to call someone.\" So, do the boys who inspired \"He Never Got Enough Love\" and \"Little Angel, Little Brother\" actually die, by which I mean fictionally die?

She doesn't fake spontaneity--she honors it as one of the constellation of life virtues she hopes her songs evoke and subsume. Protruding from this metaphysical quest, her palpable concern for her ex-lover and warm affection for her mom are strengthened rather than compromised, and when she disses her dead mom's funeral, the bile seems organic by contrast.

Harsher and dreamier than In Concert, louder and sweeter than Agharta or Pangaea, this well-tweaked 1974 concert culminates the aesthetic. Where pure funk subsumes jazz and rock in a new conception, albeit one that privileges rock, Miles leaves the two elements distinct and recognizable. Dave Liebman is good for wild-to-mellow jazz input that's solidified by a Coltranesque house call from Azar Lawrence, and for rock there are three guitarists: Reggie Lucas and Dominique Gaumont wah-riffing the rhythm as Chess session man turned cult hero Pete Cosey launches wah-wah-inflected noise into the arena-rock stratosphere.

The audio is shrill at first, and the lead track's guitar is as crude as it got in Zaire--but also, how rock and roll, as exciting. Always conscious of country and city, Wemba has been the rare African to hold his own with synthesizers, yet homes in on two village chants.  He deploys manly shout, girlish falsetto, gritty tenor, and mellow midrange to describe, explain, celebrate, ululate, sigh, cajole, declare his love, and state the facts.

In a band that made a point of prolonging foreplay, it's like a serial climax, and the effect can be exhausting and even disorienting. But as you might imagine, it's also very exciting, an opportunity to concentrate on the deep vertical pleasures of music that makes forward motion a first principle.

       "  \"Despite my immense misgivings--Newman's political sensitivity, a useful attribute in one conceptualizing about the South, has never impressed me--I'm convinced that this is Newman's second-best album. It also rights a career that was threatening to wind down into cheap sarcasm. Contrary to published report, the white Southerners Newman sings about/from are never objects of contempt. Even Newman's psychotic and exhibitionist and moron show dignity and imagination, and the rednecks of the album's most notorious songs are imbued by the smart-ass Los Angeles Jew who created them with ironic distance, a smart-ass's kindest cut of all. There is, natcherly, a darker irony: no matter how smart they are about how dumb they are, they still can't think of anything better to do than keep the niggers down.\",\n",

And though Newman\\'s pact with musical theatre requires him to sacrifice music, where his gifts are huge, for theatre, where he\\'s a novice, the songs themselves are rich, mocking rock, religion, musical comedy, the classix, and American culture all at once. Newman\\'s Devil is a midlife whiner, James Taylor\\'s God a palavering politician, Don Henley\\'s Faust a bigger creep than both of them put together, Bonnie Raitt and Linda Ronstadt\\'s good girl-bad girl a set piece. Yet these brontosauri dance through their dress rehearsal with the found grace of busmen on holiday, and the pleasure Newman takes in his hubris is so ebullient that the satire never turns cheap. If the project reeks of concept album, well, pardon me for reading--the songs do get even better once you take in the plot summary. And if it reeks of burlesque, well, how better to bum-rush Western civ and \"America\\'s greatest art form\" simultaneously?',\n",
       "  'After an annuity\\'s worth of soundtracks, a box stuffed with marginalia, and Faust, his first true album since 1988 finds him more cynical than ever, about himself above all. Having called one cheap joke \"I\\'m Dead (But I Don\\'t Know It),\" he explains the belated tribute to the wife and family he kissed off in the \\'70s with a simple \"I\\'d sell my soul and your souls for a song,\" then announces: \"But I wanted to write you one/Before I quit/And this one\\'s it.\" Thing is, cheap jokes and cynicism have always been his gift to the world, and when he\\'s on he can twist the knife. In joke mode, check out not only \"I\\'m Dead,\" so anti-Randy it\\'ll have young yahoos saying amen like they just discovered Mahalia Jackson, but two of his cruelest political songs ever: one a history of early imperialism where the punch line is HIV, another addressed with dulcet malice to Mr. Karl Marx. For cynicism, try \"My Country,\" which might just be about his family too, and \"Shame,\" where Newman plays a hateful old hard-on indistinguishable from himself. Twisting his croak a turn further are the most articulate arrangements of his singer-songwriting life: jazzlike, but in a piano-based rock context that shifts at a moment\\'s notice to any voicing (Hollywood-symphonic, country march, pop-schlock) that might reshade a meaning or make the ear believe what the mind can\\'t stand. There are a few ringers. But the last time he was so strong in this mode he was married to the wife he misses.',\n",
       "  'Post-hippie, Newman\\'s cynicism was tonic. Post-post-hippie, it curdled. Now, freshened by frailty and outrage, it\\'s restorative again. Describing a near-death experience in the title song, he injects a kindness he\\'s rarely risked into absurdist jokes that are as mean as ever, and that moment of compassion adds depth to the three political songs in the middle, two of which target a privileged class that explicitly includes the artiste. The other rearranges 2007\\'s caustic YouTube special \"A Few Words in Defense of Our Country\": \"The end of an empire/Messy at best/This empire\\'s ending/Like all the rest.\" Did he write those lines in five minutes, fussing for a little longer over \"messy,\" or wait years for them to come? Lyrically, every one of these 10 songs in 34 minutes raises that question, reinforced by the quietest and most casual singing of Newman\\'s mush-mouthed career. Musically, however, he\\'s a fine jeweler, a busy beaver and an old pro. Never have his arrangements exploited his soundtrack chops so subtly, changeably or precisely. You say you want the failure of the American Dream? Try a marching band put through its paces by a dyspeptic Kurt Weill. King Leopold of Belgium? How about a little \"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah\"? Arrhythmia?

In the golden age of Top 40, his albums were afterthought product, filled out with autopilot instrumentals, threadbare covers, wan novelties, and temperate lounge blues. So Chuck Berry\\'s natural longform is the best-of, compelling fans to buy his classics over and over. This 71-track threefer from the innocent days when box sets meant something slackens slightly on the back half of disc two by indulging Berry\\'s blues dreams. But disc three documents the renaissance that followed his release from an 18-month bid on a trumped-up prostitution charge in late 1963. The unsatisfied \"No Particular Place to Go\" and the pot-dealing action thriller \"Tulane\" aren\\'t iconic like \"Johnny B.

Having never stopped loving his art whatever his personal failings, I rate this a crucial addition to what I damn well call his oeuvre. His son Charles Jr. plays creditable second guitar, his daughter Ingrid adds harmonica, and while the locals on piano and drums obviously aren\\'t Johnny Johnson or Fred Belew, they\\'ve clearly lived this music.

That said, I intend to keep trying. The mad genius of this album is producer-songwriter Dennis Walker, who having long ago sculpted Robert Cray as an obsessed adulterer-cuckold now turns three of the bluesman's male-chauvinist classics into painful cries of victimization and, with help from guitarist Alan Mirikitani, crafts a batch of long-suffering miniatures that make the record. But Lavette makes the songs--though she's gritty and loves to testify, she never overdoes it. What's more, she's got the psychological equilibrium to find optimistic material she can put across just as passionately. That's why Walker sequenced the material to move Lavette toward independence--and wrote the strong-willed title track with a woman.\",\n",

And \"interpretations\" they\\'re not. Instead LaVette invents a truly new Dylan--a Dylan who\\'s an African-Ameican woman. Sure this Dylan has \"soul\"--reservoirs of empathy and spiritual mojo the Dylan we know could only gesture at, cut with a deep seam of the sardonic skepticism that never leaves him alone and finished off with a range, texture, and definition beyond the capabilities of his aging larynx. But the invention goes deeper than that. With R&B master drummer Steve Jordan overseeing an unfailing groove, LaVette messes with the songs at will, not just by changing genders as storylines require--\"Don\\'t Fall Apart on Me Tonight\" is so different addressed to a man--and introducing the terms \"bullshit\" and \"fucked up\" to Dylan\\'s lexicon, but by swapping and omitting stanzas and updating historical references, Annie Oakley and Belle Starr to Otis Redding and Bruno Mars. The closing \"Going, Going Gone,\" which has no real place on 1973\\'s Planet Waves, darkens the album\\'s political through-line.

From back when he came on like a nicer relation of Stuart Murdoch, Lekman\\'s romanticism and indeed sexuality have always had a lot of agape in it, hinting at social consciousness only insofar as agape is social consciousness\\'s engine and embodiment.

What accent he has is subsumed in his high, sharp, unexpectedly comedic flow. He embellishes his simple beats with deft choruses and tunelets, and his African effects are savvy and unforced. The album opens with water music I\\'d tag as Mbuti, meaning forest-derived, although Somalia is desert--a sound I\\'ve always believed rappers should sample for the delight of it, and that he makes signify.

There I learned that recording began on the day Kouyate's friend the president was overthrown by the military, and that two songs celebrate anti-Islamist heroes of 19th-century Mali--a martyr whose refusal to leave his animist faith inspired his Muslim protector to fight to his own death for it and a soldier who drank beer in the sanctimonious face of the Muslim cheikh who'd persuaded him to fight for a faith he refused to obey to the letter. From the title party anthem on out, the mood and message are inclusive not just because sharia law proscribes music altogether but because Timbuktu anti-clericalist Khaira Arby gets a track, because the Taj Mahal cameo is the most irreverent Malian blues ever recorded, because every song is fired by Kouyate's political and philosophical passion. Two melodies reach back centuries. Strong-voiced frontwoman Amy Sacko delivers the word.

Once in a while a guitar part backs up a tasty phrase, and when the time comes, someone in Bright Eyes will gracefully provide it.

Noname carries the first half of the 35-minute album pretty much alone. But when other vocalists join her--Ravyn Lenae, Phoelix, Smino & Saba--their role is to augment and embellish her sound rather than change it up. Not only is she the boss, she\\'s the source.

The resulting counterpoint is the true expression of Clapton's genius, which has always been synthetic rather than innovative, steeped in blues anti-utopianism.

Beyond the top-drawer drummers--Al Foster, Roy Haynes, Steve Jordan--are such serviceable sidemen as bassist Bob Cranshaw and electric (!) piano player Mark Soskin. But because the concept foregrounds melody and straight-ahead swing, this may even be a plus, because it leaves the focus on the star of the show.

In the hall of mirrors that is Chuck Berry\\'s catalogue, this is where to get oriented.

Of these, Roach\\'s are generally the most musical, with Jones\\'s fuller and solider than Haig\\'s and the single solo Kotick gets room for higher in content than any of Heath\\'s walks, which do saunter some as his half proceeds. But the core is 25 minutes of unimpeded Bird. The two \"Cosmic Rays\" should be one at most, and four takes of the midtempo blues \"Chi-Chi\" is one too many, although the CD-only add-on is welcome because it\\'s where Parker drops the virtuoso boilerplate and sticks to what may be blues boilerplate but who cares. Everything else is superb: two standards, Parker\\'s \"Laird Baird\" sounding like a standard itself, the non-rote virtuosity of two lightning-quick \"I Got Rhythm\"-based \"Kim\"s, the only studio version of his oft-covered \"Confirmation,\" and the definitive rendition of the title original, which in 1949 provided r&b journeyman Paul Williams the materials for a dance smash called \"The Hucklebuck\" that isn\\'t the first rock and roll record but deserves a nomination.',\n",

An Amazon post from Stephen Putt of Warren \"Vacate Our Election Board, Journalistic Terrorists\" Ohio put me straight: \"I bought this cd at walmart. there was no indication on the cd that the songs were not sung by the original bands. I tried to return this cd at walmart and they wouldn\\'t take it back. basically if you want a collection of worship music done by the original bands and singers. Dont buy this cd.\" How \"naive,\" shot back a co-religionist who\\'d attended a camp run by compiler Joel Engle: \"Believe it or not, the vast majority of these songs do not \\'belong\\' to any one band, but have been written by songwriters and can be sung by anyone who gets permission.\" Or doesn\\'t get permission, actually. Strategic marketers have long known that sacred truth. Just like Christian retailers know what\\'s nine-tenths of God\\'s law.',\n",

    "I've been reading Christgau's reviews for a while. The reason I decided to embark on this analysis is because I often find myself completely unable to understand his reviews, let alone be able to infer from the review what the grade was. His references are frequent and esoteric, and the dense and complex vocabulary is employs can border on unreadable. Oftentimes I'll think I'm reading a C-range review only to get to the end and see it's in the A-range. I want to see if a computer could do any better than me.\n",

It's because Moby still loves song form that he elects to sample Alan Lomax field recordings rather than garage-sale instrumental and spoken-word LPs. But though the blues and gospel and more gospel testify not just for song but for body and spirit, they wouldn't shout anywhere near as loud and clear without the mastermind's ministrations--his grooves, his pacing, his textures, his harmonies, sometimes his tunes, and mostly his grooves, which honor not just dance music but the entire rock tradition it's part of. Although the futurist's dream of Blind Willie Johnson that opens this complete work was some kind of hit in England, here it'll be strictly for aesthetes. We've earned it.\"\n",
